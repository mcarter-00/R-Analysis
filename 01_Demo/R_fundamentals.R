# Programming and ETL in R

# Simple Data Structure: Assignment Operator
## all environment objects are mutable; can be assigned/reassigned multiple times.
x <- 3
x <- 5

# Simple Data Structure: Numeric Vector
## an ordered list of numbers using the c() function
## "num[1:10]" = a numeric object with 1 row and 10 columns of values
numlist <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

# Advanced Data Structure: Matrix 
## "a vector of vectors", where each value is the same data type.

# Advanced Data Structure: Data Frame
## very similar to a Pandas DataFrame where each column can be a different data type.

# Advanced Data Structure: Tibble
## a recent data object introduced by the tidyverse package in R
## an optimized data frame with extra metadata and features.


# ?<name of function>

# Importing data files
?read.csv()

# Import 'jsonlite' library
library(jsonlite)

# Import JSON file
?fromJSON()

# Select data using [] notation
## ex: select the third row of the Year column
demo_table[3, "Year"]
## can also select the same data using just number indices aka row/column indices.
demo_table[3, 3]

# Using $ operator, select vector of vehicle classes from demo_table;
## using '$', we can select columns from any two-dimensional R data structure 
## as a single vector, similar to selecting a series from a Pandas DataFrame.
demo_table$"Vehicle_Class"

# When vector is selected, use bracket notation to select a single value.
demo_table$"Vehicle_Class"[2]

# Select Data with Logical Operators -- similiar to Python
## Filter used cars by price greater than $10,000
filter_table <- demo_table2[demo_table2$"price">10000]

# Another method to filter and subset data frames
?subset()
filter_table2 <- subset(demo_table2, price > 10000 & drive == "4wd")

?sample()
